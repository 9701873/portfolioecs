         <p>
         I am the region champs with my doubles partner for JV Second Doubles.
         We did not lose a single match this year, except the end one against Olympus at Regionals.
         My oppurtunities from tennis include meeting awesome new friends and playing constantly on nice tennis courts provided by our school
         Tennis matches of mine against other schools allow me to play against those who are better than me, so I can better myself.
         I love playing tennis with my team because there are some amazing individuals who can play tennis amazingly well.
